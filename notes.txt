SECTION 11 FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:

TODO:. The slice method returns a copy of an array into a new array.
        The original array will not be modified.
     . eg( const animals = ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant']
            console.log(animals.slice(2, 5)) // ['camel', 'duck']
            console.log(animals) // ['ant', 'bison', 'camel', 'duck', 'elephant']
        )

TODO:. The splice method is used to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements .
        it directly modifies the original array and returns an array conaining the deleted elements.
     . splice(1, 2) in this 1 is the starting index and 2 is how many elements should be removed from the starting index.
     . eg( let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']
           let removed = fruits.splice(1, 2) //Fruits is now ['apple', 'date']
           // removedFruits is ['banana', 'cherry']
     )

TODO:. insertAdjacentHTML method is used to add html elemets via javascript.
        It is similar to innerHTML.
        insertAdjacentHTML takes two parameters.
            *first parameter is where to add there are four types(afterbegin,beforebegin, beforeend, afterend).
            *second parameter is what html we need to insert into the element.
        eg( body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', html) ), 
            where afterbegin is where to add the element and the html is the html code we want to insert into to body element.

TODO:. find method is an array method used to loop through the array and returns the first value that satisfies a specific condition.
         if no elements matches the condition it returns undefined.
       .eg ( arra.find((element) => {
            return element.name === 'Messi';
        }));
         returns the first element that has the name property equal to Messi.

TODO:. findIndex method in an array is used to loop through an array and returns the index of the first element that satisfies a specific condition.
        if no element mathches the condition it returns undefined.
     . eg( arr.findIndex((element) => {
        return element.name === 'Messi';
     }));
        returns the first element that has  the name property equal to Messi.

TODO:. The object.groupby method in js loops throug an iterable like an array and turns it into an object according to the string values returned from a callback function.
     .  eg( let variable = Object.groupBy(array, (a) => {
            return a > 0 ? 'first' : 'second'
       }) )
       This retuns an Object with two keys named first and second.The first and second will be an array. the first array will have the positive values and the other will have the negative values. 
     . eg( const groupedAccount = Object.groupBy(array, (arr) => acc.type) )
         this will make a new object and group it int arrays based on the type of the objects.

TODO:. The toReversed method is used to reverse an array without mutating the original array.
        unlike reverse method toReversed method does not change the original array.
     . eg( arr.toReversed() )
        this will take a copy of the arr array and reverse the array.
     . SIMILAR( ( toReversed(), reverse() ), (toSorted(), sort() ), ( toSpliced(), splice() ))
        these are the other method similar to the toReversed method

SECTION 10 FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:FIXME:

TODO: .Js Does not have passing by reference. 
    The reference that we pass pass is a value.
    It is a value that contains a memmory address. 
    Basically we pass a referece to the funcion but we do not pass by a referece.


TODO:. Js has first class funcion it enable us to write Higher order functions.

    *first class functions
        .Treats functions as first class citizens
        .This means that function are simply treated as values
        .Function are just another type of object in js.
        .functions are values too
        .can pass functions as arguments to other functions.
        .eg (bind())
    
    *Higher order functions
        .A function that receives another function as an argument, that returns a new function, or both
        .this is only possible because of first class function.
        .eg (addEventListener())

TODO:. Advantages of callBack function

        .allow us to split up to code to reusable codes.
        .(imp) callBack functions allow us to create abstraction.
    

TODO:. The this keyword depends on how the function is called.
        .if the function is called by the object (eg jonas.book()),
            the this keyword points to the jonas object.
        .if the function is called not by the object (eg: the book method is stored outside in a varible),
            the this keyword points to undefined.

        *How to tell js what the this keyword should look like. using 
            *call():
                    .call(<this keyword>, <rest of the parameters>)
                    .we call the call method first and then the call method calls the funcion
                          with the this keyword set to the first argument we pass in the call method.
                    .eg( book.call(jonas, 23, 'Jonas Schmedtmann) ). 
                          jonas is the this keyword and the rest of the arguments is like normal arguments.
            *apply():
                    .apply method does not receives arguments after the this keyword like call method
                    .it take an array of arguments.
                    .not used in modern js. better is call method;
                    .eg( bood.apply(jonas, flightData) ). flightData is an array. jonas is this keyword
            *bind(): 
                    .bind method does not immediatly call the function.
                    .instead it returns a new funtion where the this keyword is whatever the values we pass into the bind.
                    .eg( const bookEw = book.bind(eurowings)
                         bookEw(23, 'steven Williams')). 
                    the bind method returned a funtion,
                    and it is stored in bookEw variable . 
                    where the bookEw has the eurowings bound as the this keyword.


TODO:. In closure a function has access to the variable enviornment of the execution context in which the functiion was created,
        even after that execution context is finished executing.
    .A closure is the closed over variable enviornment of the execution context in  which a funcion was created, 
        even after that execution context is gone.
    .A closure give a function access to all the variable of its parent function , even after that parent function has returned.
        the function keeps reference to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.
